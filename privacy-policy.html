    <p class="intro">
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>PageSage AI: Smart Webpage &amp; Article Summarizer</strong>
        ("the Extension", "we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use our Chrome extension.
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>

    <!-- 1. Overview -->
    <section>
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
            PageSage AI is an AI-powered browser extension that summarizes webpages, articles, and blogs.
            It allows users to extract key points, ask questions, and identify core insights from any webpage.
            The Extension is designed with a privacy-first approach — we do not collect, store, or transmit
            any personal data.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. What Data Is Collected -->
    <section>
        <h2>2. What Data Is Collected</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>We do not collect any personal data, browsing history, analytics, or personally identifiable information.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When you use the Extension, the following data is processed <strong>locally on your device</strong> or sent <strong>directly to your chosen AI provider</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Webpage text content:</strong> When you click the Extension and request a summary or ask a question,
                the text content of the currently active webpage is extracted. This text is sent directly to the third-party
                AI API you have selected (Google Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic) solely for generating a summary or answering
                your question. The Extension does not store this text after the request is completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User preferences:</strong> Your API key, selected AI provider, and chosen model are stored locally
                in your browser using <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. These preferences never leave your device except
                when your API key is sent to the respective AI provider to authenticate your request.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Extension does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (name, email, address, phone number, etc.)</li>
            <li>Browsing history or activity</li>
            <li>User accounts or login credentials</li>
            <li>Analytics, telemetry, or usage statistics</li>
            <li>Cookies or tracking data</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. How Data Is Used -->
    <section>
        <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
        <p>Data processed by the Extension is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Generating summaries and answering questions:</strong> Extracted webpage text is sent to the
                AI provider you have chosen so that a summary or answer can be returned to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Storing your preferences:</strong> Your API key, provider selection, and model choice are saved
                locally so you do not need to re-enter them each time you use the Extension.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            No data is used for advertising, profiling, marketing, or any purpose other than the core functionality
            described above.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Third-Party Services -->
    <section>
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension connects to one of the following third-party AI services based on your selection.
            <strong>You provide your own API key</strong> to authenticate with these services:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Gemini API</strong> — <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AI Terms of Service</a></li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI API</strong> — <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Anthropic API</strong> — <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When a summary or question is requested, the extracted webpage text and your API key are sent directly to the
            selected provider's API endpoint. The handling of that data by the provider is governed by the provider's own
            privacy policy and terms of service. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of your chosen provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            No data is sent to any other third-party service, server, or endpoint operated by us or anyone else.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Permissions Used -->
    <section>
        <h2>5. Permissions Used</h2>
        <p>The Extension requests the following Chrome permissions, each for a specific and limited purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><code>activeTab</code></strong> — Grants temporary access to the content of the currently active
                tab only when you click the Extension. This allows the Extension to read the webpage text for summarization.
                It does not provide access to other tabs or persistent background access.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><code>scripting</code></strong> — Used to inject a content script into the active tab to extract
                the visible text content of the page. This script runs only when you initiate a summary or question request.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><code>storage</code></strong> — Used to save your preferences (API key, selected AI provider, and
                model choice) locally in your browser via <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. No data is synced or transmitted.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Data Storage -->
    <section>
        <h2>6. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All user preferences (API key, provider selection, and model choice) are stored locally on your device using
            Chrome's built-in <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API. This data remains on your machine and is not transmitted
            to any external server operated by us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Webpage text extracted for summarization is held only in memory for the duration of the API request and is not
            persisted to disk, local storage, or any external database.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Data Security -->
    <section>
        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable measures to protect the data handled by the Extension:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All API communications with third-party AI providers are transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.</li>
            <li>Your API key is stored only in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>, which is sandboxed to the Extension and inaccessible to other extensions or websites.</li>
            <li>No data is stored on external servers, databases, or cloud services operated by us.</li>
            <li>The Extension does not include any analytics, tracking, or telemetry code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While we strive to protect your information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or
            storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping your API key confidential.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Data Sharing and Transfers -->
    <section>
        <h2>8. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or transfer your data to any third party.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The only external transmission of data occurs when webpage text is sent to the AI provider you have selected
            for the purpose of generating a summary or answering a question. This is initiated solely by your action and
            is necessary for the Extension to function.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 9. Children's Privacy -->
    <section>
        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
            from children. Since the Extension does not collect any personal information from any user, there is no risk of
            inadvertently collecting data from minors. If you believe a child has somehow provided personal information through
            the Extension, please contact us and we will take steps to address the concern.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy -->
    <section>
        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational,
            legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Effective Date" at the top.
            We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your
            information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your continued use of the Extension after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the
            updated policy.
        </p>
